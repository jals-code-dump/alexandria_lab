Investment Appraisal and Evaluation

Part 1: Directive

 

JSP 507 Part 1 (V6.0 Jan 14)

 
 Foreword

Sound appraisal and evaluation is the key to providing clear and transparent support for
Evidence-Based Decision Making. Appraisal is the means by which the Department’s
policy objective of achieving Value for Money is demonstrated. Evaluation of projects,
programmes and policies post-implementation is important to ensure good practice is
perpetuated and lessons are learned.

| am pleased to present this updated guide, prepared by the Appraisal and Evaluation
team within Defence Economics. JSP 507 promulgates the policy requirements and
comprehensive practical guidance for undertaking appraisal and evaluation, and
supplements the HM Treasury Green Book — Appraisal and Evaluation in Central
Government. Whilst in the main intended for practitioners, this guide will also help non-
practitioners to further their understanding of these tools for decision making.

 Preface

How to use this JSP

1. JSP 507 is intended as a practical handbook on the application of appraisal and
evaluation in the MOD. It is designed to be used by staff responsible for producing
appraisals, and planning and carrying out project evaluations. It is also for those
overseeing, scrutinising, and reviewing appraisals and evaluation plans. The JSP contains
advice on the processes involved and the techniques to apply when preparing appraisals
and evaluations.

2. The JSP is structured in two parts:

a. Part1- Directive, which provides direction that must be followed, in
accordance with Statute, or Policy mandated by Defence or on Defence by
Central Governement.

b. Part 2 Guidance, which provides the guidance that will assist the user to
comply with the Directive.

Training

3. No guide or manual can give all the answers. Training in investment appraisals is
provided by the Defence Academy who regularly run a two-day training course called
‘Investment Appraisal Skills’ (E043). All staff tasked with undertaking an IA for the first time
should attend this or a similar course. Some TLBs operate their own IA training courses.

4. The Financial Skills Certificate (FSC) includes elements covering Investment
Appraisal and Evaluation. Ideally, all IAs should be undertaken or reviewed by an
individual with Intermediate Level FSC certificate in Investment Appraisal.

 1 The Principles of Appraisal and
Evaluation

This chapter explains what appraisal and evaluation are, and what they are for. It explains
why appraisals and evaluations need to be objective and well planned, and that special
care and consultation with Defence Economics is needed for cases going to Ministers.

An investment appraisal should be undertaken whenever a decision has to be reached
which would involve the commitment of resources, or which would result in measurable
benefits. Appraisal enables decisions to be made with a clear understanding of the costs
and benefits of different choices.

The depth of appraisal should be commensurate with the scale, complexity, and sensitivity
of the project, programme, or policy being appraised. An appraisal that covers all the steps
in this guide is required when the capital investment exceeds £1M, or where total resource
consumption over the planning period exceeds £10M. Some form of appraisal should be
carried out on all expenditure proposals.

All projects, programmes, and policies requiring an investment appraisal should also be
subject to subsequent evaluation. Plans for this should accompany the investment
appraisal.

What is Appraisal?

1. Appraisal or Investment Appraisal (IA) is so called because its techniques have
been developed mainly in the context of investment decisions. However, appraisal is
equally applicable to decisions where no investment is involved.

2. Appraisal is a systematic process which entails being clear about the
requirement, thinking about alternative ways of meeting the requirement, and estimating
and presenting the costs and benefits of each potentially worthwhile option. It enables
decisions about the use of resources or the generation of benefits to be taken with a better
knowledge of their implications.

Why Appraisal Matters

3. In large measure public administration is about choices. Ultimately choices are
made by Ministers or within a framework set by them. Ministers need the means to take
informed decisions however, and it is government policy that investment appraisal
techniques should be applied to major decisions involving the commitment of public funds.
Government Accounting says:

“Investment appraisal (or more generally option appraisal) is an important part of

good financial management, and it should always be applied to major capital
developments.”

1 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 4. PUS, as Principal Accounting Officer, is answerable to Parliament, through the
Secretary of State for Defence, for the efficient and effective use of MOD resources, and
appears before the Public Accounts Committee to answer for the use of MOD resources. If
decisions can be shown to be based on sound and thorough appraisals, and are properly
evaluated, then the position of the Accounting Officer is protected.

The Purpose of Appraisal
5. An investment appraisal serves three main purposes.

a. Its prime function is to give the responsible manager the information he or she
needs to make a sound decision. As such, appraisal is an essential part of the
search for best value for money.

b. When a decision is outside the manager’s delegated authority, then an appraisal
will need to be presented as part of a submission for approval, and will form an
important part of the case for gaining approval. A thorough appraisal that is well
documented and presented will help to demonstrate that the project is soundly
based and will smooth the process of gaining approval.

c. The appraisal also provides a record of what was expected to be achieved by the
project and the factors on which the decision was based. It will be an important
starting point for any later review or audit of the project, and in particular for
project evaluation.

6. The aim is not to reduce decision taking to mere mechanics, but rather to place it
on a rational and informed basis in which decisions are taken with a clear understanding of
the costs and benefits of the available options.

Value for Money

7. In pursuing policy objectives, the objective of all public sector bodies is to
achieve Value for Money (VfM) defined as optimising net social costs and benefits. The
assessment of value is based upon the interests of society as a whole rather than to MOD
or the public sector alone (see Part 2, Chapter 5, paragraph 27).

VfM can be defined as the optimal combination of:

a. Economy — i.e. Cost of Inputs (I/M : Inputs/Money)
b. Efficiency — i.e. Ratio of Output to Inputs (O/I : Outputs/Inputs
c. Effectiveness — i.e. Value of Outcomes from Outputs (V/O : Value/Outputs)

Hence VfM = I/M x O/I x V/O = V/M (Value / Money)

8. VfM can also be expressed as the optimal trade-off between time, cost and
effectiveness. This does not necessarily mean choosing the lowest cost bid, nor highest
performance regardless of the consequences. VfM is derived using the methodology set
out in this Guide to provide a through life cost expressed in Net Present Value (NPV)
terms considered alongside other significant factors that have not been possible to
sensibly value (see Part 2, Chapter 5).

9. VfM is a relative concept which involves the comparison of potential and actual
outcomes of alternative procurement options. VfM is only meaningful where options exist.

2 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 Where there is only one option then there is no real way of assessing VfM and in these
circumstances the key is to achieve the most acceptable cost.

The Main Forms of Appraisal

10. As Government bodies are concerned with the well-being of the country;
appraisals carried out by Government Departments will normally be prepared on the basis
of the costs and benefits of using national resources. Here the cost is the ‘opportunity
cost’, or loss of the alternative use to which those resources could be put (see Part 2,
chapter 1, paragraph 35). Transfers of cash for which no goods or services are provided in
return (called ‘transfer payments’) are not included (see Part 2, Chapter 1, paragraph 47).
These appraisals are called ‘Economic Appraisals’.

11. In some cases economic appraisals will take the form of a COST BENEFIT
ANALYSIS (CBA), in which all of the costs and benefits of an activity are quantified and
valued in monetary terms. The results of a CBA can be used not only to say which option
is best, but also to indicate whether this option is worthwhile, i.e. does it provide a benefit
exceeding its cost.

Example

The Health and Safety Executive produces CBAs of all proposals for new health and
safety regulations. This involves estimating the extra cost employers will face in complying
with the requirement, and the benefits in terms of reduced likelihood of deaths, injuries,
illness and interruptions to work. These benefits are then given a monetary value based on
the results of research into the costs of accidents and peoples’ willingness to pay to
reduce the risk of death and injury. The net present value of the difference between the
costs and benefits can then be calculated.

12. As few activities within MOD produce benefits that can be valued in monetary
terms, the use of full-blown CBA by MOD is extremely limited. One of the few areas where
a CBA would be useful would be proposed health and safety or environmental measures
that go beyond statutory requirements. Defence Economics should be consulted as to
whether and how a CBA might be prepared in such cases.

13. Instead, most MOD appraisals take the form of a COST EFFECTIVENESS
ANALYSIS (CEA), which estimates the net present cost of alternative ways of achieving
the same requirement. When there are differences in the extent to which the requirement
is achieved, these will be noted, and as far as possible quantified, using measures which
may be judgemental.

14. By including the status quo in the comparison of options, a CEA can establish
whether any alternative option is worthwhile, as well as which option is best. It cannot
though, on its own, establish whether the activity itself is worthwhile.

15. A highly formalised type of CEA is used for appraisal of new military equipment,
and for other appraisals where the options to meet a requirement offer different levels of
military or business effectiveness. This is the COMBINED OPERATIONAL
EFFECTIVENESS AND INVESTMENT APPRAISAL (COEIA). Here, the total through-life
costs of the options to meet a particular requirement are estimated in the Investment

3 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 Appraisal. The individual parameters contributing to overall performance are identified, and
each option assessed against each of these parameters in the Operational Effectiveness

Assessment. The two separate assessments are then combined to identify the overall cost
effectiveness of each option. Guidance on COEIAs is provided in Part 2, chapter 2.

When an Investment Appraisal Should Be Undertaken

16. An investment appraisal should be undertaken whenever a decision has to be
reached which would involve the commitment of resources; or which would result in
measurable benefits. Examples include:

a. anew recruitment policy,

b. a works or accommodation project,
c. an equipment procurement,

d. a suggested redeployment,

e. estate rationalisation,

f. support for military exercises;

g. “spend to save” measures.

17. The depth of appraisal and the effort applied should be commensurate with the
scale, complexity, and sensitivity of the project, programme, or policy.

Investment Appraisal Thresholds

Criteria Threshold

Capital Investment Exceeds £1M

Total resource consumption over Exceeds £10M (excluding depreciation and cost of
Planning Review period capital charges)

Novel or Contentious expenditure All proposals regardless of value
(see JSP 462)

18. An appraisal that covers all the steps described in this Guide is required where
the capital investment, i.e. expenditure on new assets, or on refurbishing existing assets,
exceeds £1M; or where total resource consumption, i.e. operating costs (excluding
depreciation and cost of capital charge), is expected to exceed £10M over the planning
period. This is an approximate guide only; the presumption should normally be in favour of
a full appraisal for borderline cases, unless there are compelling reasons otherwise.
However, expenditure proposals below this level should still be subject to a business case
that will need to address the same basic questions as those addressed in an investment
appraisal.

Example

Suppose it is proposed to use a building with a book value of £4M as accommodation for a
group of relocated staff. New IT will be installed at a cost of £0.5M. Total resource costs of
the organisation being relocated will be £2.5M p.a.

For IA threshold purposes, the cost of new capital is £0.5M, (new assets, inclusive of
project management fees), and would not need a full IA. But total of costs in the planning
period is £10M hence a full investment appraisal is required.

4 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 19. Senior Finance Officers (SFOs) have discretion to set lower limits for mandatory
appraisal. Where SFOs decide to apply lower limits for mandatory appraisal, these should
be followed. It remains the case that the basic principles of appraisal should be applied to
all investment decisions, whatever threshold is set. There may well be cases below the
threshold where an appraisal covering all the steps described in this Guide is appropriate
because of the complexity or sensitivity of the project.

Who is Responsible for Undertaking Investment Appraisals?

20. Effective appraisal, evaluation and scrutiny are fundamental requirements of HM
Treasury delegations and spending authority. Investment Appraisal is a key part of the
management decision-making process, and not merely a finance or audit responsibility.

21. SFOs are responsible to DG Finance for the coverage and quality of investment
appraisal throughout their area of responsibility. They should make arrangements for
monitoring, and should make sure that they are made aware of any decision which runs
counter to the conclusions of an investment appraisal, and any case where significant
expenditure is to be committed without appraisal. They are required to cover investment
appraisal in their annual reports to DG Finance on Corporate Governance in their area.

22. Within TLBs, appraisals should be carried out by the line management area
responsible for implementing the project, programme or policy. Additionally, where projects
span TLB boundaries, responsibility for the appraisal lies with the lead TLB. Advice should
be sought as required from finance staff, TLB Appraisal and Evaluation teams, Defence
Economics, and other specialists.

Planning

23. It_is important that_appraisal is carried out in an open minded and _ objective
manner, rather than used to support a decision which has already been made. The

appraisal should be carefully planned. The sponsor should ensure that the necessary
resources are provided to carry out a thorough appraisal at the right time.

 

24. As part of the planning process the sponsor needs to consider who should be
consulted and when, and to allow adequate time for this consultation. It is good practice to
identify who will be involved in the eventual approval of the project, and to make sure that
their staffs are consulted on the appraisal in draft and are content with it. That should
reduce the risk of having to respond at short notice to queries or objections which are
raised on the final submission, when a decision is needed urgently.

25. Care should be taken not to constrain unduly the conduct of the appraisal, for
example by setting terms of reference that specify particular options, or a particular
appraisal timescale.

Cases for Ministers

26. Particular care is needed in cases that go to Ministers for their approval. The
investment involved may be quite small in financial terms, but these cases can be
sensitive - because they involve redundancies or impact on the local economy, or because
there is political interest in the subject. The Minister will undoubtedly seek advice from the
appropriate Central staffs; so the sponsor of the project should ensure that these staffs

5 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 have the opportunity to see the submission and supporting appraisal in draft, and to
resolve any points of difficulty.

27. It is embarrassing to the Department when flaws in an appraisal are detected
only after a submission has gone to Ministers. Likewise, it is embarrassing to Ministers
when flaws are not found until after the Minister has gone public, say by approving the
issue of a consultative document. Ministers are entitled to a better service from the
Department. No submission should be put to Ministers until the sponsor is entirely
confident that the submission and supporting appraisal will stand up to scrutiny.

Scrutiny

28. Once an appraisal has been completed, both it and the recommendation for
action arising from it must be independently scrutinised, in order to protect the position of
the Budget Holder, and to ensure that value for money is likely to be achieved. This
scrutiny role is often filled by the Budget Manager. Additional information on Budget
Holder/Manager responsibilities can be found in JSP 462.

29. Scrutiny should not be limited to the recommendation for action, but should
encompass the requirement itself. Requirement scrutiny is designed to ensure that only
fully justified requirements, which demonstrably contribute to the organisation’s agreed
outputs, are approved. A financial scrutiny is carried out to ensure that approved
requirements are affordable, that they are regular and proper charges to the Defence
Budget, and that they represent value for money. Scrutiny should also consider the options
rejected, and must be completed before the proposal passes up the approvals chain.

Role of Defence Economics

30. Defence Economics is responsible for the formulation and dissemination of policy
on Investment Appraisal and Evaluation throughout the Department, and the Chief
Economist represents MOD in discussions with HM Treasury about interpretation of, and
addition to, the Green Book.

31. Defence Economics endorsement of all [As which are to go to Ministers, the
Investment Approvals Committee (IAC), and its delegated Authority or which will support
submissions that will do so is required. Defence Economics will provide advice, assistance
and Scrutiny for all Centrally Approved cases. Early engagement is recommended, and
regular contact should be maintained with Defence Economics throughout the period up
until the main decision point. Defence Economics also has a formal scrutiny role in the
assessment of benefits presented in cases submitted to the IAC.

32. Defence Economics’ advice and assistance may be sought on any other
appraisal though requests should normally be routed through the relevant TLB focal point.
Defence Economics will review a sample of such appraisals for DG Finance’s Annual
Health of Financial Systems report.

TLB Appraisal and Evaluation Teams
33. Appraisal and evaluation teams, within each TLB, act as a focal point for advice

and expertise on these subjects and Scrutiny, where they fall within the TLB’s delegated
authority. Staff should seek guidance from these teams in the first instance, and at an early

6 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 stage. Proposals involving potentially novel or contentious expenditure must be brought to
their attention as soon as possible.

34. SFOs and Agency Chief Executives are responsible to DG Finance for the
coverage and quality of investment appraisal throughout their areas of responsibility. They
should make arrangements for monitoring, and should make sure that they are made
aware of any decision which runs counter to the conclusions of an investment appraisal,
and any case where significant expenditure is committed without appraisal. They are
required to cover investment appraisals and evaluations in their annual reports to DG
Finance on the Health of the Financial Systems in their areas.

What is Evaluation?

35. Evaluation is the retrospective analysis of how well a project, programme, or policy
is delivering against its performance, time and cost parameters.

36. When decisions have been taken and implemented, it is then important to monitor
and evaluate the outcome. Only in this way can we hope to learn from our experience, avoid
mistakes, and improve the quality of future management decisions.

What is the Purpose of Evaluation?

37. A fundamental requirement of HM Treasury delegation is that spending proposals
are subject to effective appraisal and evaluation. Effective evaluation reinforces the
accountability of Budget Holders for the resources under their control.

38. The main purpose of evaluation is to ensure that good practice is perpetuated,
lessons are learned, and the Department avoids repeating costly mistakes. It is not a tool for
apportioning blame, but a vital source of information for management decision making. It
should also lead to improved project control and governance, and is essential to be able to
gauge the level of optimism built into project estimates.

39. Evaluation is sometimes seen as a burdensome chore, tying up scarce
resources for no immediate benefit. However, by analysing what went right and what went
wrong on a project, and why, future performance can be improved and more value
obtained from the defence budget. Evaluation should not be viewed as a post-mortem, but
rather as a means of learning from experience.

What to Address in an Evaluation
40. An evaluation should address three distinct and interlinked elements:

a. Technical requirements and operational capability
b. Financial and commercial control
c. Project governance and control

41. The evaluation should assess what went well and why, and what didn’t go well and
why within all three elements. A good evaluation distinguishes between what has happened
as a result of active management of the project, and what has happened because of
unforeseeable external factors. The temptation to attribute, unfairly, successes to the former,
and failures or problems to the latter should be avoided, if the evaluation is conducted
objectively. A suggested template for evaluation is provided at Annex to Part 2, chapter 2.

7 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 When to Undertake an Evaluation

42. Every project, programme, or policy requiring an appraisal should be evaluated.
The extent and depth of evaluation should be commensurate with the value, length and
complexity of the project, programme or policy to ensure the efficient allocation of resources.

43. A straightforward, low value project may only require a short evaluation at the end
of the project life. For larger, longer running projects, programmes, and policies, greater
depth of evaluation will be required. For these, an evaluation should be undertaken after
each major stage of the project lifecycle e.g. initiation, initial gate, main gate, contract award,
in-service, and on disposal or termination. This should be planned for at project initiation,
given that on any project, resources are limited.

44. Performing regular reviews at predetermined stages in the project lifecycle, where
the team considers performance against expectations and discusses the reasons for
differences, enables the timely identification of lessons that can be applied to the next stage
of the project life cycle. Evaluation should also be carried out at other major project
milestones e.g. a project manager leaving, in order to prevent a loss of valuable project
knowledge.

45. Any project that stops or experiences any issues not previously envisaged should
conduct a detailed evaluation of the issues, causes and remedial actions, including the
effectiveness of remedial actions.

Who is Responsible for Undertaking Evaluations?

46. Evaluation is a line management responsibility, and thus the responsibility for
evaluation rests with the management area responsible for the project, programme or
policy. Evaluation should be carried out by existing resources, with external facilitation or
support if required, and be an integral part of the project process. The majority of effort and
activity should complement other project controls such as risk management, stakeholder
involvement and communication.

47. If a project is sponsored in one management area but executed in another, the
two areas should agree on who is to undertake the evaluation. However, since the ultimate
objectives of the project are those of the sponsoring area, the presumption should be that
itis this area that carries out the evaluation. For example, a procurement project should be
evaluated by the Customer for the equipment, and an accommodation project by the
Garrison Commander. The Senior Finance Officer (SFO) in a TLB is responsible to DG
Finance for ensuring the robustness of systems to support evaluation, as is the Chief
Executive in an Agency. As part of this responsibility, SFOs and Chief Executives should
ensure that procedures are in place in their areas to manage the process of project
evaluation.

8 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 Disseminating Lessons Learned

48. One of the key reasons for undertaking evaluations is to learn lessons for the
future. Lessons learned should be captured and disseminated across TLBs within the
Department and with industry at various levels identified in the governance. Project staff
should include plans for the conduct of an evaluation in the original appraisal, rather than
simply stating that an evaluation will be carried out.

49. The distribution of the evaluation should be such that lessons learned are
communicated to others likely to benefit. The evaluations of projects, policies or
programmes that were reviewed by Defence Economics prior to their approval should also
be forwarded to Defence Economics for collation and analysis of key lessons.

Appraisal and Evaluation within the Management Framework

50. Both the appraisal and evaluation form part of a framework for management of
policies and programmes called the ROAMEF Framework (see Figure 1a). ROAMEF
stands for Rationale, Objectives, Appraisal (of options), Monitoring, Evaluation and
Feedback. Rationale is the need for the policy or programme. The Objectives flow from the
need identified as being unmet, whilst Appraisal is the assessment of the possible options
to meet those needs. Monitoring is the continuous review of the project operation, and
evaluation is the assessment of the full effects of the project against a previously
determined baseline. Feedback is communicating the results of evaluation to those
concerned with the original project or with related projects. HM Treasury recommend this
framework is applied by all Government Departments.

 2 The Elements of Business Cases and
Appraisals

A business case must be prepared for all proposals that would involve the commitment of
resources or which would result in measurable benefits. The business case must include five
key elements:

a. The Strategic Case;

b. The Economic Case;

c. The Commercial Case;
d. The Financial Case;

e. The Management Case.

An investment appraisal addresses the Economic Case. A well-conducted investment
appraisal should include the following elements in sequence, addressing key issues relevant
to each. These are:

a. the options being considered and the reasons for their selection;
b. short-listing of the options;

c. the costs and benefits of the various options;

d. assessment of risks;

e. sensitivity analysis;

f. other factors leading to the choice of a recommended option.

What Is A Business Case?

1. The Business Case is a management tool and is developed over time as a living
document as the proposal develops. The Business Case keeps together and summarises the
results of the analysis needed to support decision making in a transparent way. In its final
form it becomes the key document of record for the proposal, also summarising objectives,
the key features of implementation management and arrangements for post implementation
evaluation.

2. Business cases can cover a wide range of types and levels of project, programme,
or policy. The effort expended on developing the proposal should be proportionate to the
likely costs and benefits.

Business Case Structure

3. Business cases should contain the five elements defined by HM Treasury’s best
practice ‘Five-Case’ Model. These are:

a. The Strategic Case. This will set out why the proposal is needed, the background
to the proposal, the requirement, any over-riding and binding constraints, and any
dependencies.

b. The Economic Case. This considers the options for delivery and the assessment
of Value for Money (VfM) (see Chapter 1, paragraph 7).

10 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 c. The Commercial Case. This sets out the procurement strategy and considers the
commercial viability of the proposal.

d. The Financial Case. This establishes the affordability and financing of the
proposal.

e. The Management Case. This sets out how the proposal will be delivered in
project and programme management terms, and the plans for evaluation of the
proposal.

4. All of these aspects are important; however, their size will vary from proposal to
proposal depending upon its nature and complexity. Some less complex business cases
particularly those not involving significant new procurement, new systems or new building
construction may need little or nothing by way of a commercial case and require a less
complex management case.

5. Business Case Templates for proposals that will be approved within TLB or
Project Team delegation are available from Individual TLB Approval Teams. Cases
seeking central approval must consult the Approvals Guidance.

The Development of the Business Case

6. The Business Case should develop iteratively over time, often in two distinct stages
with more detail being provided at each stage.

Initial Gate Business Case (IGBC)

7. The Initial Gate business case seeks approval to undertake an assessment of
the options (the Assessment Phase), within a defined Performance, Cost and Time (PCT)
envelope, in order to determine which can best meet the requirement i.e. to reach, support
and achieve a main investment decision at Main Gate. It includes an assessment of the
risks and benefits of options for presentation at Main Gate. Issues should not, except in
exceptional circumstances, be addressed in terms of a particular solution. The aim is to
keep the options open, with specific recommendations being more appropriate to Main
Gate approval.

8. An Initial Gate approval is normally required before formally engaging the private
sector (e.g. by advertising the requirement in the MOD Contracts Bulletin and the Official
Journal of the European Union). Exceptionally, the Initial Gate may be omitted for lower value
and low risk cases with the agreement of the relevant Approving Authorities.

9. The key elements of the IGBC are:

a. The Strategic Case — outline the capability gap and the requirement to make a
robust case for change. Determine benefits, risks, constraints, and
dependencies;

b. The Economic Case — set out the long-list of alternative options, and an initially
recommended shortlist for further examination. Indicative costs and benefits for
short-listed options should be provided;

c. The Commercial Case — set out a procurement strategy for the Assessment
Phase (or equivalent);

d. The Financial Case — discuss the likely affordability of the proposal,

e. The Management Case —outline how the project will be set up and managed.
Set out an exit strategy.

11 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 Main Gate Business Case (MGBC)

10. The purpose of the MGBC is to revisit the IGBC in more detail and to identify a
preferred option which demonstrably optimises VfM. It also sets out the likely deal;
demonstrates its affordability; and details the supporting Procurement Strategy, together
with management arrangements for the successful rollout of the proposal.

11. Main Gate constitutes the main investment decision where the Department
commits to the full cost of the programme. This is usually taken to be the point at which a
Preferred Bidder (PB) is selected. By this stage, the risks remaining in the project should
be well understood and there should be sufficient confidence to take a Main Gate decision.

12. The key elements of the MGBC are:

a. The Strategic Case — revisited and revised if required.

b. The Economic Case — the value for money position is clear, supported by an
endorsed investment appraisal completed in accordance with JSP 507, or a
should-cost model for single-source cases;

c. The Commercial Case — the procurement strategy is clear and indicates whether
there will be any further decision points post Main Gate;

d. The Financial Case — affordability and funding issues resolved;

e. The Management Case — the detailed plans for delivery and arrangements for
the realisation of benefits, management of risk; and post evaluation are
recorded.

The Strategic Case

13. The strategic case sets out the case for the proposal. It should set out the
background to the proposal and the objective to be achieved. The fit with the wider public
policy objectives and the department’s corporate plan should also be explained. Any
constraints to competition should be explained, and any interaction with or dependency on
any other proposals, e.g. the fit with published targets such as Public Service Agreements.
Lessons learned from previous experience in this area should be briefly set out.

Background

14. The background to the project, programme, or policy should be explained in
sufficient depth so that the reader can understand why the need has arisen, and why the
requirement (which should be stated explicitly) has been defined as it has. Material that is
merely of historical interest should be excluded.

Requirement

15. It is necessary to establish how individual projects are linked to delivering final
Defence outputs. Procuring an asset or service, or putting in place a scheme is not an
appropriate requirement in itself. The requirement should generally be predicated on the
need to, for example:

a. provide further economies in the provision of an existing service;

b. improve business effectiveness and service quality in terms of the required
outcomes;

c. improve efficiencies in the throughput of services;

12 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 d. meet statutory requirements and obligations;
e. meet policy changes;
f. deliver new business and operational targets.

16. The requirement must be clearly set out so that its achievement can be monitored.
Clarity in the setting of the requirement allows for scrutiny, and also assists in identifying the
full range of options which may be available to deliver the proposal.

17. The requirement should be expressed clearly and concisely in terms of the
outcomes, effect, or service to be delivered. It must not be expressed in a way that
anticipates or pre-empts a particular solution.

18. A clear statement of requirement is necessary for three main reasons:

a. Generating options. Clearly defined objectives make the process of generating
options much easier. Requirements should reflect only the absolute essentials.
Options can be assessed against the objectives to see if they are worthy of
consideration. Ill-defined objectives are likely to lead to unnecessary work; time
spent considering unsuitable options is time wasted. However, objectives should
not be set so tightly that they exclude otherwise worthwhile options and lead to
costly re-workings at a later date. Care must be taken to ensure that options are
not solution specific, nor should options be excluded solely on the grounds of
affordability in an existing budget.

b. Selecting the Preferred Option. The selection of the preferred option involves an
assessment of all the costs of delivering outputs. With clear objectives and an
indication of their relative importance, it will be easier to identify and quantify all the
costs and benefits involved.

c. Evaluation. Evaluation is the process of measuring the project outcomes against
those forecast in the investment appraisal or against some other agreed
baseline. The absence of detailed objectives makes this task difficult, if not
impossible.

19. In the equipment environment a capability audit would be used to establish the
Single Statement of User Need (SSUN). This sets the scope for the User Requirement
Document (URD) in which more detailed and individual requirements and constraints are
set out. More information can be found on the AOF (aof.mod.uk).

Constraints

20. Open and fair competition is a fundamental component of MOD acquisition policy
in delivering affordable defence capability at overall long term VfM, and is a legal
requirement in many circumstances. Competitive procurement helps to deliver VfM
because it gives suppliers an incentive to reduce costs, increase productivity and
encourage innovation by continually benchmarking them against their competitors.

21. The ability to run a competitive procurement may be affected by defence
strategic considerations and market constraints. Project teams should identify whether any
constraints apply, and where they do, seek early engagement with Defence Economics or
the relevant TLB Appraisal team, particularly where the existence of constraints potentially

13 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 results in only one option being available to meet the requirement (see Chapter 3,
paragraph 28.

Dependencies

22. Any actions or developments required of others should be considered if the
ultimate success of the project, programme, or policy is dependent upon them.

The Economic Case

23. This is the essential core of the business case and sets out the demonstration of
value for money. This section of the business case assesses the economic costs and
benefits of the proposal to society as a whole, and spans the entire period covered by the
proposal.

Options

24. Options should be generated with reference to the requirement. As wide a range of
options as possible should be considered in the early stages to reduce the likelihood of
expensive and time consuming revisiting at a later date. Involving all those who have a
legitimate interest in the outcome of the decision may help in this respect.

25. The options considered in the appraisal should be clearly and simply described,
and the reasons for their selection should be fully explained. The list of options must
include an option that will act as the baseline for determining value for money. Depending
on the circumstances of the case, this may be either:

a. ‘Do nothing’ i.e. where it is feasible to cease an activity; or

b. The ‘status quo’, i.e. continuing the existing service at the same level and in the
same way; or

c. ‘Do minimum’, i.e. doing the least that has to be done to comply with the
requirement (for example meeting minimum Health and Safety standards).

Consideration of the potential for private sector involvement in delivering the requirement
should also be considered at this stage (see Chapter 3, and Part 2, Chapter 8).

26. Those involved in generating options should be imaginative, not always opting for
the obvious solutions. For example, if appraising a collocation project, sites other than those
currently occupied should be considered. (Early contact should be made with the Defence
Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) (Estate Rationalisation) team, who will be able to advise on
the availability of Defence sites to meet specific requirements.) The availability of comparable
facilities in other Commands and Services should be explored if the provision of new facilities
is being contemplated. Options involving varying the scale or timing of a project should be
explored as a means of potentially increasing VfM, as should all the individual elements.

27. Usually there will be a wide range of possible solutions to a specific problem. It
will be rare for there to be only one possible option, and where this is the case, robust
justification will be needed. You should consult your SFO, TLB Appraisal and Evaluation
team, or Defence Economics, in such cases. Where there is genuinely only one possible
option available to meet the identified objectives, a costed investment appraisal is not
required (see Chapter 3). However, it is still important to establish value for money, and
the affordability of that option.

 

 

14 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 Examples of options for a collocation project:
a. Refurbish existing facilities;
b. Maintenance by the private sector;
c. Options to rent, build or purchase;
d. Varying locations or sites;
e. Provision of the service or facility by the private sector;
f. Co-location with other agencies

Short-listing the Options

28. It is sensible to appraise in full (i.e. explicitly work through all the steps described
in this guide) only those options that are considered feasible. However, the reasons for
rejecting options without appraising them fully should always be made explicit. Reasons
for exclusion might for example be obviously poor VfM or unacceptable or unmanageable
risks. Potentially viable best VfM solutions must not be eliminated at this stage.

29. The short-list must:

a. Include the ‘do nothing’, ‘status quo’, or ‘do minimum’ option, which provides the
benchmark for assessing value for money; and,

b. Transparently record the reasoning and evidence behind the rejection of each
excluded option.

30. The shortlist must not:

a. Rule out options because they are “radical”, or because their appraisal will be
difficult, given the uncertainties that require resolution, or because they involve
confronting vested interests;

b. Reject options only because they have fewer benefits than some other more
costly option;

c. Prematurely discard options; or,

d. Reject options on grounds of affordability, without confirming the overriding
nature of the budget restraint.

31. Options should not be discarded without being appraised simply because they cost
more than the budget provision in a specific year, or for a particular item, because they may
nevertheless be better value for money in the longer run than ‘affordable’ options. In principle,
funding can be increased by re-allocating funds. Ultimately, a judgement may be made that
funding constraints are such that a second best option must be adopted. But unless the
‘unaffordable’ option is included in the appraisal, it will never be possible to make an informed
judgement on the best way ahead. It is essential that the appraisal provides an audit trail that
demonstrates that the full range of options has been considered; so options should not be
ruled out at an early stage on affordability grounds.

32. If it will be difficult to reverse any decision, it may be particularly important to
consider deferral or implementation in a more flexible manner. All short-listed options must
be capable of financial and non-financial analysis. However, not all need be subjected to a

15 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 full appraisal (for example, because of their obvious inferiority). Best practice requires a
presentation of a full range of options, if only in broad outline.

Costs and Benefits

33. Costs and benefits (quantified and unquantified) of each option should be set out
clearly. To guard against error, and to ease the scrutiny process, costs and benefits should
be presented on a ‘full cost’ basis rather than as differences from a baseline. Although
decision-making is ultimately concerned with the differences between the costs of the
options, and the two methods ought to give the same result, carrying out the costing on a
‘differential’ basis has the following disadvantages:

a. There is a risk of making mistakes, either omitting items or double counting them
as costs in one option and benefits in another;

b. Important information may be lost - a difference in staff costs of £100,000 per
annum is much more significant if the total staff cost is £1m a year than if it is
£10M;

c. It becomes very difficult for someone scrutinising the appraisal to understand the
figures and to form a judgement on the soundness of the appraisal.

34. There is a judgement to make about the amount of detail to include in the
presentation. Investment appraisals should include discounted cash flow tables in which
the costs and benefits of each option are expressed in real terms (i.e. constant price levels
excluding general inflation). There should be sufficient detail for the key cost drivers to be
identified, and to give the reader confidence that all cost elements have been included, but
not so much that important information is difficult to disentangle. The assumptions on
which the costings have been based should be clearly documented, and explanatory notes
should give sources for all data.

35. It is not credible that future costs can be estimated to the nearest pound. Often
estimates for major projects will only be accurate to the nearest £100,000 or £1M and
should be rounded accordingly. Presenting more detail results in spurious accuracy and
simply clutters the presentation. In smaller projects it may be appropriate to round to the
nearest £1,000. The results of sensitivity and scenario analyses should be included in
presentations and summary reports, rather than just single point estimates of expected
values. It is also important to check that spreadsheets, after reduction and photocopying,
can be read easily.

36. The level of effort to identify and quantify costs and benefits for each option should
be commensurate with the scale and complexity of the project. When identifying costs and
benefits, consideration should be given to whether options might generate losses or special
payments.

Optimism Bias and Risk
37. In appraisals, there is always likely to be some difference between what is
expected, and what eventually happens. As a result an assessment of the risks associated

with each option must be made. At the early stages of a project, programme, or policy, when
risk management proposals are relatively undeveloped, an explicit allowance for optimism

16 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 bias (see Part 2, chapter 6) should be made against all options, regardless of the size or
complexity of the proposal.

38. Optimism bias is the demonstrated, systematic, tendency for project appraisers
to be overly optimistic about key project parameters. Appraisers tend to overstate benefits,
and understate timings and costs, both capital and operational.

39. As the business case develops, a more detailed assessment of individual risks and
risk management will be required for larger projects. In these cases an optimism bias
assessment will then be used as a ‘sanity check’ of the risk assessment. For small projects
the risk premium may continue to be encompassed by a general uplift to offset and allow for
undue optimism bias. As costs are firmed, the level of optimism bias will decrease (see Part
2, Chapter 6).

Sensitivity analysis

40. All appraisals must contain a sensitivity analysis to test the vulnerability of
options to future uncertainties, such as changes to flying hours, equipment numbers, or
Out of Service Date (OSD). The sensitivity analysis should be based on plausible
variations to the assumptions made, perhaps based on evaluation of previous projects.
The values at which key variables would cause costs or benefit values to change enough
to affect the choice of preferred option should be explored. For example, how much would
the cost of procuring a new IT system have to rise to outweigh the expected cost-savings it
will provide? (For further information see Part 2, chapter 6, paragraph 73).

Other factors

41. The BC should show that every effort has been made to quantify all relevant costs
and benefits. Sometimes there are genuinely unquantifiable costs and benefits associated
with a proposal. Where this is the case they should be clearly explained along with the
reasons why quantification can not reasonably be made. Where they are relevant to the
choice of option, alternative methods may be used to support option selection. It is important
however that such analysis is transparent and that it is not structured in such a way as to
produce a biased or predetermined result.

42. Any such factors considered relevant to the decision should be agreed with
Defence Economics or the relevant TLB Appraisal and Evaluation team (see Part 2,
chapter 5 for further details).

Whole Economy Impacts

43. MOD investment appraisals are concerned with appraising public value; that is
the value to UK society of a proposal or option rather than just to the Exchequer or the
Department. Wider social costs and benefits should only be included in an investment
appraisal where:

a. They can be reliably estimated on a sound empirical basis;

b. Where they are material to the proposal; and

c. Where it is proportionate to do so bearing in mind the costs, benefits and risks of
the proposal and the time and resources available.

17 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 44. In practice, wider economy impacts are not included in investment appraisals,
even when the choice is between domestic and overseas options (see Part 2, Chapter 5,
paragraph 27).

Recommendation

45. The recommended solution should be supported by a transparent and logical
argument showing clearly why it has been chosen, and how the various factors (the costs
and benefits covered by the appraisal, the risks and uncertainties involved, other
business/operational factors, security, wider policy issues and affordability) have affected
the choice.

Writing up the Appraisal

46. For small projects the presentation of the appraisal results covering these
elements can be incorporated into the business case. However, for larger projects,
particularly those covered by the Approvals Guidance, separate Investment Appraisal and
Business Case documents should be produced. When preparing separate Investment
Appraisal and Business Case documents, it is not necessary to duplicate information
required in the Business Case within the Investment Appraisal.

The Commercial Case

47. The commercial case is concerned with issues of commercial feasibility and sets
out to answer the question “can the proposed solution be effectively delivered through a
workable commercial deal or deals?” The first question, therefore, is what procurement does
the proposal require, is it crucial to delivery and what is the procurement strategy?

48. The procurement strategy should be clearly set out in the commercial case and the
ownership of any assets should be clearly defined and key contractual issues identified and
explained, together with the proposed solution.

49. The allocation of risk must be clearly explained and the business case should
include a risk table showing risk allocation and the steps which are being taken to mitigate
risk. Any personnel implications also need to be fully explained and if TUPE is involved this
has to be properly included in the delivery plans (see Part 2, chapter 4). (TUPE refers to the
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006).

50. The commercial case should show key contractual milestones and delivery dates
and should clearly set out the agreed accounting treatment. Detailed guidance can be found
in the Acquisition Operating Framework (AOF) Commercial Toolkit.
http:/Awww.aof.dii.r.mil.uk/aofcontent/tactical/toolkit/index.htm

The Financial Case

51. The financial case is concerned with issues of affordability, and sources of budget
funding. It covers the lifespan of the scheme and all attributable costs. The case needs to
demonstrate that funding has been secured and that it falls within appropriate spending and
settlement limits. The focus in this section of the case is on capital and resource
requirements (near-cash or non-cash) and so here VAT and capital charges are included.
The financial case is concerned with the budgetary impact.

18 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 52. Issues in addition to the proposal’s affordability are:

a. does the financial case identify and fill any funding gaps,

b. does it contain provision for dealing with the financing of any time or cost
overruns,

c. does it fully explain and estimate any contingent liabilities that may result from
the proposal?

The Management Case

53. The management case is concerned with the deliverability of the proposal and is
sometimes referred to as programme management or project management case. The
management case must clearly set out management responsibilities, governance and
reporting arrangements, if it does not then the business case is not yet complete. The Senior
Responsible Owner should be identified.

54. The management case should include a delivery plan with clear milestones which
relate to but are at a more detailed level than contractual milestones. The management plan
applies to any programme or projects required by the proposal. Programme and project plans
must include business assurance arrangements. Where so-called controlled environments
such as information and communications technology are involved or complex business
systems then the use of PRINCE2 methodology is mandatory for programme and project
management. Where significant change management is involved, a change management
and stakeholder management plan should be included.

55. The management plan should also set out clearly any OGC Gateway Review
arrangements, and should contain a benefit realisation plan and benefit register. The
management plan should also include a contract management plan and arrangements where
contracts are required. There should be a contingency plan with arrangements and plans for
risk management and a risk register.

Monitoring and Evaluation

56. All business cases should include a plan for monitoring their effects and a plan
for subsequent evaluation. This should be more than an assertion that an evaluation will
be carried out: it should show how the success or failure of the project will be measured;
what data will be needed to support that measurement; and how that data will be collected;
and when and by whom this is to be undertaken. These should include provision in both
economic and financial cases for the associated monitoring and post implementation
evaluation costs. This monitoring and feedback provision is essential to the longer term
evolution of evidence based policy and without it the business case is not complete.

 Annex A: Business Case Checklist

The following checklist highlights some of the key points that should be considered when
preparing a business case.

The Strategic Case

Justify the requirement

e What has generated the need for this expenditure?

e What capability gap has been identified?

e Express the requirement clearly and concisely — without a full understanding of the
requirement, it is difficult to identify all the possible methods of addressing and
meeting the need.

e What are the key objectives of the proposal?

e What outputs are required? When?

e« Do not pre-empt the solution — ensure the requirement is expressed in output related
terms that do not unnecessarily restrict the number of possible options.

e Decisions should not be taken prior to the completion of the IA.

e Are constraints and dependencies identified and managed?

The Economic Case

Develop possible options

e Need to consider all possible options for achieving the objectives.

e Always include do nothing / status quo / do minimum options.

e Options should not be constrained by affordability.

e When considering options for private sector delivery a value for money benchmark
must be developed.

e There should be no presumption either in favour or against in-house versus private
sector provision.

Short-list the options
e No option should be rejected without properly supported explanations.
e Acceptable reasons for rejection include similar but inferior to another option, or not
feasible.
e Not acceptable include discarding on grounds of affordability or not fully meeting user
requirement.
e All assumptions should be supported.

Time horizon
e A realistic timescale should be chosen depending on the nature and life of the project,
e.g. life of the major fixed asset or period over which the service is required.
e Could involve replacement of assets in some options, e.g. computer systems.

Identify and quantify costs and benefits
e Costs and benefits should cover the whole life of the project and consider all impacts
of the project regardless of budget area.
e Ignore sunk costs.
e Ensure costs and benefits are expressed in “real terms” (see Part 2, chapter 1).
e Firm price contract costs should be deflated prior to discounting.

20 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 Include opportunity costs, running costs and savings / receipts as appropriate.

e Include residual values where appropriate.

e “Contingencies”, “premia”, “running costs” or other generic headings should always be
supported and explained.

e Use a 3.5% Discount Rate to calculate Net Present Value (NPV). (For project

durations exceeding 30 years refer to Part 2, chapter 1, paragraphs 15 - 18).

Include allowance for relative price inflation as appropriate.

Exclude interest on capital, depreciation, VAT and general inflation.

Ensure data and assumptions are recorded and agreed by stakeholders.

Common costs should ideally be included (see Part 1, chapter 1, paragraph 43).

Risk Assessment
e In larger projects, key risks should be assessed, evaluated and if possible, quantified,
with particular emphasis on how it is intended to mitigate or manage them.
e« Anoptimism bias assessment should be undertaken on all options, where appropriate.
e Is there a risk allocation table?

Sensitivity Analysis
e Sensitivity analysis of key variables should be undertaken in all cases.
e Plausible variations to assumptions should be applied to test the impact on the ranking
of options.

Non-quantifiable factors
e Are there any costs and benefits relevant to individual options that have not been
quantified in the appraisal?

Recommendation
e Of the options considered which represents best value for money for the
Department?
e If this is not the recommended route, state the justification

Working papers

e Should be clear and retained for audit purpose. They will also potentially assist in
any Project Evaluation.

Defence Economics Consultation
e Defence Economics must be consulted on appraisals that will eventually be
presented to Ministers, the Investment Approvals Committee, and its delegated
Authorities or which will support submissions that will do so. Defence Economics
will provide advice, assistance and scrutiny for all Centrally approved cases.

The Commercial Case

Is the proposal commercially feasible / deliverable?

What procurement is required; goods, services, land, buildings?
What is the procurement strategy?

What are the key contractual issues?

 3 Involving the Private Sector

The extent of involvement of the private sector can vary from minor elements of a proposal
being contracted-out through to full privatisation, with various forms of contracting,
outsourcing, partnering and PFls in between.

Careful consideration needs to be given to which procurement route is likely to be most
effective. In some cases, the appropriate balance between public and private sector
provision will be clear. In others, the best solution must be identified across a range of
public, private and partnership options. The key objective is to ensure that taxpayers get
value for money.

Introduction

1. Private sector provision may be more likely to provide a better solution where the
scope for the following is greatest:

. Innovation to reduce costs or to improve observable outcomes;

. Generating additional revenue flows by sales to third parties;

. Reduction in risk of cost overrun or benefit shortfall;

. A contractor is able to exploit economies of scale in the provision of services

(e.g. IT support or facilities maintenance);

e. Savings in whole life costs and/ or for improved outcomes through effective
design (e.g.: where a broad range of services may be provided in association
with an asset, or when many inputs must be integrated in delivering a service, or
where whole life and operating costs are importantly determined by good
design);

f. Clear specification of quality standards in absolute terms or in terms of client
satisfaction;

g. Ability of private sector to control discrete elements of the project without
excessive oversight or interference; or,

h. Clear boundaries and interfaces between public and private sectors.

a0 08

2. Provision by the private sector may be less appropriate where:

a. Risks which threaten the viability of a project are outside the control of the
contractor (and these risks cannot be separated contractually from the project);

b. The predominant risks are ones where the public sector has the comparative
advantage in managing them;

c. A large degree of discretion is required in determining the quality of services, and
quality is not observable; or,

d. Bidding costs are large in proportion to the value of the project (although there
may be means of reducing these costs).

Risk transfer
3. When faced with significant risks, transferring part or all of it to the private sector
should be considered. The governing principle is that risk should be allocated to whichever

party from the public or private sector is best placed to manage it. The optimal allocation of

23 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 risk, rather than maximising risk transfer, is the objective, and is vital to ensuring that the
best solution is found. Accordingly, the degree to which risk is transferred depends upon
the specific proposal being appraised.

4. Successful negotiation of risk transfer requires a clear understanding by the
procuring authority of the risks presented by a proposal, the broad impact that these risks
may have on the suppliers’ incentives and financing costs, and the limits to risk transfer
which might still be considered for value for money.

5. Where the private sector has clear ownership, responsibility and control, it should
be encouraged to take and mitigate all of those risks it can manage more effectively than
the procuring authority. If the procuring authority seeks to reserve many of the
responsibilities and controls that go hand-in-hand with service delivery and yet still seek to
transfer significant risk, there is a danger that the private sector will increase its prices.

6. A risk allocation table can be a useful tool to identify the bearer of each risk
relevant to a proposal. An example of this is set out below:

Risk Allocation Table

Risk Scale Bearer Key Issues
Purchaser Provider
Obsolescence Low V Assets require low levels

Demand Risk Med V
Design risk High V
Residual Value Low V

Etc

Competition Policy

7. Open and fair competition is a fundamental component of MOD acquisition policy
in delivering affordable defence capability at overall long term Value for Money (VfM), and
is a legal requirement in many circumstances. Competitive procurement helps to deliver
VfM because it gives suppliers an incentive to reduce costs, increase productivity and
encourage innovation by continually benchmarking them against their competitors.
Competitive procurement is MOD’s default procurement route.

Legal Obligations
8. The following Procurement Law applies:

a. MOD is required by the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (also known as the
Procurement Regulations) to advertise and to run a competitive procurement

24 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 process for contracts for goods, works or services except where exempt under
Article 346 of the Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union.

b. MOD procurement is also subject to EU Treaty principles, including equal
treatment, transparency and non-discrimination that should apply to all MOD
procurements that fall within the scope of the Treaty even where the
Procurement Regulations do not apply.

Non-legally binding obligations

9. Teams should continue to adhere to the European Defence Agency’s Code of
Conduct on Defence Procurement to contract for goods and services that benefit from the
Article 346 exemption and are above the threshold of Euro 1 million.

The benefits of competition

10. Competitive procurement delivers benefits by tackling two basic problems.
Firstly; there is an asymmetry of information between MOD and its suppliers in that the
latter are far better informed about the likely cost of providing a particular capability, yet
have an incentive to overstate these costs to the customer in order to increase their profits.
Secondly, once a contract has been signed suppliers may have an incentive to act in ways
which benefit their interests at the expense of the customer.

11. Competition partly resolves these issues by providing a benchmarking function in
that it allows the MOD to compare prices across a range of suppliers, giving it more
information. Firms competing for the contract have an incentive to bid as low as possible
(whilst still earning an acceptable amount of profit) in order to maximise their chances of
winning. This will tend to force firms’ bids down closer to their true costs of production
making them a better indicator of their costs.

12. After a contract has been signed, competition exerts pressure through a different
mechanism. If a supplier knows that the MOD has a range of potential alternative
providers, the incentives for them to engage in behaviour which might lead to
unsatisfactory performance and hence risk them losing future business, are reduced.

Limitations of competition

13. The key limitation on the use of competition in defence procurement is the small
number of potential suppliers, with most areas of the market having only a handful of firms
capable of acting at the prime contractor level. This is exacerbated by significant barriers
to entry in the form of the large up-front capital investments and the required technological
expertise. These make it difficult for new firms to ‘break into’ the market, making the
consequences of a firm exiting the market on the level of competition more severe.

14. A consequence of this is that MOD procurement decisions can have a significant
impact on the structure of the market. As a result of losing a particular competition a firm
may no longer have sufficient orders to sustain its industrial capacity. The nature of the
competitive process means that unless they can somehow sustain this capacity the firm
will slowly be driven out of the market by their rivals, reducing the level of competition in
the long run.

15. This can lead to ‘winner takes all’ type competitions in which firms have a strong
incentive to submit overly optimistic bids in order to win the contract, with the expectation

25 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 that when problems emerge in the future they will be able to renegotiate terms because
the MOD is already locked into the contract and / or there are no credible alternative
suppliers left in the market.

16. More broadly, the adversarial nature of competition discourages defence firms
from being completely open with the MOD for fear that information might leak to their
competitors, giving them a commercial advantage. Where a project contains significant
technological or programme risks this reduced openness may result in problems not being
identified and dealt with early, leading to shortfalls in performance on time / cost /
effectiveness.

Constraints on Competitive Procurement

17. The ability to run an open and fair competitive procurement may be affected by
defence strategic considerations and market constraints. Project teams should identify
whether any constraints apply, and where they do, seek early engagement with Defence
Economics or the relevant TLB Appraisal and Evaluation team.

18. Project teams are likely to have to justify any constraint due to defence strategic
activities under a treaty exemption or general exclusion from EU procurement law. If a
project team has any doubt about the application of an exemption or exclusion, they
should seek legal advice from CLS-CL. If a treaty exemption or general exclusion does not
apply, project teams will have to justify any single source procurement due to market
constraints under Regulation 16 of the Defence and Security Public Contract Regulations
(DSPCR) 2011 or Regulation 14 of Public Contract Regulations 2006.

19. As set out in the National Security Through Technology White Paper, published
in February 2012, the principle of Open Procurement is qualified by the principle of
Technology Advantage. Technology advantage comprises two elements: freedom of
action and operational advantage:

a. Operational Advantage (Op Adv) is the ability to find and maintain an edge
over potential adversaries, both to increase the chances of our success in
hostile situations and to increase the protection of the UK assets involved,
especially our people. Operational advantage can be based on a number of
factors such as superior intelligence, training and doctrine, but is particularly
important in terms of equipment and underpinning technologies;

b. Freedom of Action (FoA) is the ability to determine our internal and external
affairs and act in the country’s interests free from intervention by other states or
entities, in accordance with our legal obligations. This freedom is the essence of
national sovereignty. Different acquisition options offer differing levels of
assurance in relation to our future freedom of action, particularly where a
potential supplier is based overseas.

20. The White Paper notes that there may be occasions where we decide to protect
an aspect of capability for national security reasons. How we choose to protect that
capability will always involve a balance of risk and innovative thinking about the most cost
effective solution. We may, for instance, chose to consider working with Allies, share
military capabilities, or entering into arrangements to ensure appropriate levels of
technology sharing and security of supply. There may also be competition law and
procurement law implications to consider.

26 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 21. Where we judge that it is essential to take action to protect the UK’s operational
advantage or freedom of action, we expect to seek to protect up to four aspects of a
specific capability by obtaining specific security of supply! undertakings. These four
aspects are timely access to the:

a. essential skills and knowledge needed to design, develop, integrate, evaluate,
support and maintain key systems and sub-systems, together with the conduct
of test, evaluation, support and upgrade processes for those systems. Science,
technology, engineering, and mathematical (STEM) skills are likely to be
particularly important here.

b. facilities and infrastructure which support these processes including specialist
manufacturing and production facilities, design systems, support

c. infrastructure, and test and integration rigs;

d. technologies critical to the design and development of key systems and
subsystems; and

e. appropriate freedoms from potential legal constraints on the use of technology
(including intellectual property rights) to enable the UK and its suppliers to
maintain, upgrade, and operate key systems and sub-systems.

The timescales within which access is needed will be established as part of setting the
requirement and the delivery strategy for that capability.

22. Further guidance to assist decision makers is provided in:

Policy Guidance — Criteria for Applying Operational Advantage and Freedom of Action in
Defence Acquisition
(http://www.aof.dii.r.mil.uk/aofcontent/downloads/security/20130603_Policy-guidance-FOA
OA-U.doc)

23. In exceptional cases, where it can be clearly demonstrated that it is appropriate
to source an aspect of capability we need for our freedom of action or operational
advantage only from within the United Kingdom, MoD will seek delivery from the UK
industrial base. Competitive procurement may have to be limited to suppliers who have
appropriate facilities and personnel in the UK or the contract may have to be structured so
that it uses other protective measures such as firewalls between elements of the contract.
An aspect of capability will be regarded as being ‘retained in the UK industrial base’ if the
people possessing the skills and the facilities representing that capability reside in the UK
and the requisite Intellectual Property RIPR can be effectively utilised in the UK. Due
regard needs to be given to the impact of foreign control laws on the ability to effectively
exercise the IPR and the impact this could have on third party use of the IPR for MOD.

24. The scope for full and open competitive procurement may be further influenced
by the following market factors:

a. IPR. Access by MOD to sufficient rights to enable a third party to utilise IPR on
MoD’s behalf is fundamental to achieving competitive procurement for many MOD
requirements from research and technology right through the procurement cycle to
disposal. Where there is a sole source of supply because MOD does not possess
any or sufficient IPR, or where the risk would be too great to place work with
another party (for instance where Airworthiness Certification would be jeopardised

' Security of Supply is the ability to guarantee and be guaranteed the supply of goods and services that are
essential to military operations to prosecute the Government's foreign and security policies.

27 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 should work be placed with a party other than the Design Authority), then teams
should consider whether there is any opportunity to reformulate the requirement or
obtain licensing to open up competitive procurement.

b. Single Source Worldwide. In some circumstances there may only be a single
source of supply worldwide. If there is a single source of supply worldwide, teams
should consider whether there is any opportunity to promote competitive
procurement for example reformulating the requirement or stimulating the market. A
detailed cost/benefit and risk analysis should be undertaken to ensure that such an
approach would deliver long term VfM.

c. Limited Market Opportunities. There may be a lack of suppliers with the required
capacity to deliver the requirement or a lack of ‘real’ competitive pressure in the
market. Where there are limited market opportunities defence firms may find
themselves in a position where a competitive procurement becomes a ‘must win’
situation with failure to secure a contract likely to result in a particular industrial
capability being run down due to lack of work and becoming unsustainable. Given
the small number of firms capable of acting at the prime contractor level such a
situation could lead to an erosion of MoD’s ability to compete similar contracts in the
future. Teams should consider whether the likely impact on long term VfM is large
enough to justify the use of some other procurement approach, such as alliancing,
to sustain the long term availability of essential industrial capability, subject to the
usual value for money and affordability considerations. However, it is important that
MoD does not sustain companies that would otherwise be unviable entities due to
the legal and presentational issues involved.

Increasing the Opportunities for Competitive Procurement

25. Recognising the potential constraints imposed by strategic considerations and
market structure, teams should look to use other opportunities to promote competitive
pressure to ensure VfM is achieved.

26. The following should be considered when the procurement and commercial
strategies are being developed:

a. Review of the Defence Strategic Considerations. Where competitive procurement is
constrained due to defence strategic considerations, teams should review the
nature and scope of the constraints to establish which are overriding and to
consider the potential for trade offs.

b. Licensing of IPR. Where competitive procurement is constrained due to the lack of
rights to utilise requisite IPR, then teams should consider whether licensing IPR is a
viable option to enable competitive procurement.

c. Encouraging Competition in the Supply Network. Where it can be clearly
demonstrated that security considerations and/or market structure prohibit the use
of competitive procurement and a single source is selected, competitive
procurement to deliver VfM should be encouraged throughout the supply network in
line with the Codes of Best Practice 5 where this does not compromise UK national
security and is both feasible and appropriate. Project teams must be aware there
are specific rules for Subcontracting under the DSPCR 2011 to which they must

28 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 adhere. The team should also demonstrate how the benefits from encouraged
competition further down the supply network will feed through to the MoD.

d. Reformulation of the Requirement. Teams should consider whether the requirement
could be reformulated or redefined to bring the competitive procurement process to
bear.

e. Stimulation of the Market. It should be assessed whether the market could be
stimulated to enable a competitive procurement to be held.

f. International Collaboration. International collaboration can deliver better value to the
customer through the sharing of overheads and the benefits of economies of scale,
encouraging the evolution of the global defence technological and industrial base.

g. Co-operation with Other Government Departments (OGDs).

h. Project teams should consider whether acting collectively with OGDs to meet
competitive requirements will deliver better VfM compared to separate
Departmental action.

i. Security of Supply. Project teams must consider at the start of the procurement the
importance of an assured supply, in particular taking account of the criticality of the
goods or services to Technology Advantage. The DSPCR allows procurers to take
a number of non-discriminatory actions to protect Security of Supply. There are also
a number of formal Security of Supply arrangements in place with other nations
which can provide assurances to the UK in emergency situations.

Assessment of Value for Money

27. Project teams should identify whether any constraints apply and, where they do,
provide a full written explanation of their impact and the steps taken to maximise
competitive procurement. Teams should not approach HM Treasury for consideration of
their proposals until such work has been completed. All teams are required to provide
evidence for the audit trail and obtain independent assurance from Defence Economics or
the relevant TLB Appraisal and Evaluation team. An outline of evidence required is
provided at Annex A.

Single Option Cases

28. Circumstances may arise in which an identified requirement can only be met by
one option. An example of this may be where there is a requirement for the purchase from
the Original Equipment Manufacturer of spares in support of a particular equipment. If
there is no other supplier for the spares it can be a straightforward choice between buying
and not buying. The same may also be true when purchasing repair/servicing, Post Design
Services (PDS) or, where Intellectual Property Rights, Contractual Terms, or Design
Authority status applies. Other examples could be where operational constraints limit the
available options, or a long-term contract with options to renew or extend.

29 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 29. Options must not be limited by time or resource constraints due to poor planning
or management decisions or by departmental strategies. Agreement must be sought
from Defence Economics or the relevant TLB Appraisal & Evaluation team in all
such cases, and this does not remove the requirement to assess optimism bias,
risk, and affordability.

analysis
30. Where it has been assessed that only one viable option exists to meet a defined

requirement, it will be necessary to determine that the cost of that option is not
unreasonable. This will typically be achieved through the production of a ‘Should Cost’
model (see Part 2, Chapter 8, paragraph 11), cost comparator, or benchmark. A range of
measures may be necessary to demonstrate value for money through life (see Part 2,
chapter 8, paragraphs 41 - 51).

Routine Re-provisioning Decisions

31. Routine re-provisioning or renewal of contracts do not require an investment
appraisal or value for money assessment providing the following criteria apply:

a. A requirement exists and has been established by an existing contract;

b. Value for money has been satisfactorily delivered, evidenced by evaluation (see
Part 2, chapter 7);

c. There have been no changes in circumstance from the original procurement.

32. Evidence must be presented that consideration has been given to:

30 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 a. the remaining period the equipment is expected to remain in service;

b. the planned future utilisation of the main equipment and how this differs from past
experience;

c. spares consumption or Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) rates;
d. current levels of free stock;

e. stock return trends.

33. Where there are any other significant factors to be considered, such as potential
alternative suppliers or innovative support packages, an appraisal must be undertaken.

Business Improvement Policy

34. The overriding objective is to provide defence outputs offering best value for
money affordable to the taxpayer. As part of the process of ensuring a fair comparison can
be made between the true costs and risks of undertaking activities commercially and those
of retaining activities in-house an investment appraisal must be produced.

35. In reviewing activities, there is a need to:
set clear objectives;

ensure that the scope is fully defined and robust;
oF consider the full range of options to meet the requirement including in-house

ao

options;
d. undertake a fully detailed risk assessment;
e. achieve the best value for money outcome within available funding.
36. The scoping and feasibility stages of each review will determine the eventual

means of securing improvement. In determining the appropriate scope, consideration
should be given to the potential impact on MOD employees inside and outside the project
boundary. Whatever the eventual outcome, the review process is likely to result in new
ways of delivering services and TUs will need to be involved. Management must keep the
TUs fully informed and consult with them as appropriate and at the appropriate level. The
process must be as transparent as possible recognising commercial sensitivities, to
ensure that Trade Unions and staff understand how an objective decision will be reached.
It should be borne in mind that MOD policy for interaction with TU’s is clearly set out in the
Employee Relations Policy located in the People Services pages of the Defence Intranet
and any failure to adhere to its direction is likely to delay, rather than expedite the project.

37. TLBs or Trading Funds considering proposals for the external provision of
services will need to address the full resource implications of such projects. Potential
projects must be given proper priority and be effectively managed. If the potential benefits
from commercialisation appear to be relatively small, and are likely to be outweighed by
the costs of competition or the increased MOD management costs, the work should be
retained in-house.

38. Management must approach consultation with an open mind and seek to achieve

agreement by creating a relationship with the Trade Unions based on mutual trust through
openness, explanation and the exchange of views. Consultation is likely to involve informal

31 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 dialogue as well as the formal processes set out in the Employee Relations Policy section
of People Services on the Defence Intranet.

39. An important part of the scoping work will be the agreement of the requirement.
This should reflect the capability required, expressed in output terms. It will not necessarily
equate to the scope of work that may be contracted to industry. The requirement will form
the basis for developing options for the delivery of the required capability. In drawing up
the requirement, management must engage the Trade Unions and the workforce as fully
as possible at the earliest practicable stage.

Options

40. Once the scope of the work has been identified and the requirement has been
agreed, the context of the review will determine the nature of the assessment. Where work
is currently conducted in-house, TLBs and Trading Funds will need to ask:

a. Should some or all of the work be retained in-house, and if so how can efficiency
improvements be made?

b. Where it is judged that best value for money could be achieved by
commercialisation of some or all of the work currently conducted in-house, how
should this be done?

41. Where work is currently provided under contract with the private sector, the
issues are likely to be:

a. How is the existing contract performing?

b. Does the opportunity exist for de-scoping i.e. bringing some or all of the work back
in-house, perhaps as part of a wider in-house efficiency initiative?

c. Where contracts must be re-competed, how best should this be done?

Value for Money Benchmark

42. Reviews of business activities will always need to establish the most cost-
effective option for delivering that activity. Part of this examination will need to be an
assessment of whether any in-house processes currently in place can be improved.
Whenever a project includes an option for delivery of the requirement through a
commercial bid, an appropriate Value for Money Benchmark (VfMB) must be developed.

43. The purpose of the VfMB is to test the value for money of commercial bids. It can
take a number of different forms and may incorporate in-house provision, bought-in
services, or a mixture of the two:

a. In the majority of cases the VfMB will be an assessment of the cost of how MOD
would deliver the defined output as the best alternative to commercial bids (i.e. a
‘would cost’ model). It should not be constrained by affordability. The VfMB is likely
to be based on existing methods of delivering the requirement, but should take into
account all reasonably foreseeable efficiencies in delivering the defined output.
Trade Unions should be consulted and invited to provide suggestions for possible
efficiencies and new working practices. Every effort should be made to provide
realistic and deliverable cost estimates. However, it would not be usual to seek firm
prices from industry to inform the VfMB.

32 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 b. In larger or more complex cases, additional effort will be appropriate to establish an
operationally achievable, fully deliverable, robust benchmark. Construction of a
Fully-resourced VfMB requires the establishment of a dedicated team and budget to
provide the necessary resource to fully develop ‘do better’ or ‘do different’ options.
A Fully-resourced VfMB can add value to the competition process as it offers a
challenging, deliverable solution. However, significant costs will be incurred, and the
Department needs to be confident in advance of incurring such cost there is a
reasonable prospect of its recovery; i.e. that this option can deliver a value for
money solution.

c. A ‘Should cost’ model is an assessment of what a commercial solution to deliver the
defined output should cost. This is appropriate where the activity is not currently
provided, and could not be provided, in-house e.g. construction. The ‘should cost’
model is a theoretical construct of how the project team considers a commercial
provider would deliver the requirement. The costs of each delivery element would
be estimated from information gathered from existing sources (e.g. past contracts,
CAAS pricing), and from relevant external sources (e.g. market soundings, sector
consultants). It is not an achievable solution, but provides a target to inform contract
negotiations with commercial bidders.

44. The appropriate form of VfMB to adopt must be agreed with and endorsed by
Defence Economics, or the relevant TLB Appraisal and Evaluation team for projects within
TLB thresholds. Trade Unions must be informed and consulted. Defence Economics is the
final arbiter in the process.

Risk

45. To be a valid benchmark against which private sector bids can be compared
fairly, the VfMB must reflect not only certain procurement costs but also the risk that
additional costs may arise, which under industry proposals would fall to the supplier.
During the procurement process, risks should be identified, and ways in which these risks
can be mitigated considered. It is necessary to assess the impact of these risks on costs,
estimate their probabilities, and explore and appreciate the sensitivity of these estimates.
In many cases, adjustments to the original cost estimates will be needed to arrive at the
final risk adjusted VfMB. Comprehensive accounting for risk is required to ensure that valid
and informed comparisons can be made amongst the bids and between the bids and the
VfMB.

In-House Efficiencies
46. There will be circumstances where the best course of action for the Department
may be to continue to deliver activities in-house but to improve the efficiency of the
existing business process. Reasons may include;
a. the activity is not suitable for commercial treatment (perhaps because it is too
specialised or because business processes are too inextricably linked with tasks,
which for military reasons must be kept in-house),

b. risk cannot be satisfactorily transferred to the private sector.

The onus is on the Department to pursue all possible means of improving the efficiency of
activity delivery.

33 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 47. In examining the scope for more cost effective solutions, it is important that
management and workforce alike should realise there should be no presumption that any
previously successful In-House Bid (IHB) or VfMB should be maintained indefinitely.
However, the Department is not required to compete work won previously by IHBs if,
following rigorous investigation, they believe that commercialisation offers poor prospects
of better value for money or the cost of conducting the tender exercise outweighs the
benefits that might accrue from commercialisation. This would need to be revisited
periodically to test that it remains valid. In such cases, it will be up to management to
engage the Trade Unions and the workforce in order jointly to pursue all available means
of improving and reducing the cost of that activity in-house.

48. The Department should examine the scope for efficiencies in undertaking
activities in an innovative manner. For example, they might consider the potential scope
for "bundling" similar activities to increase the potential for synergies or economies of scale
to be realised. On the other hand, too large a span in bundling can result in over
complication and unnecessary overheads. TLBs or Trading Funds will want to take into
account experience elsewhere in the Department in deciding which activities can be
delivered and provide better value for money. It is for MOD as informed customer to
decide how best to meet its requirements, but the Trade Unions must be consulted fully at
all times. The aim must be to ensure that a comprehensive range of options are
considered at the outset and the optimum solution should be arrived at following
assessment of all relevant factors such as their viability, economic appraisal and
consistency with business plans.

Tender Evaluation

49. The Trade Unions must be invited to appoint an independent observer as part of
the bid evaluation process, as set out in the Employee Relations Policy located in the
People Services pages on the Defence Intranet.

Review of Existing Outsourced Contracts

50. Where activities are already provided by a commercial contractor, a review of all
options should consider whether the services could be provided more cost effectively in
the future. At contract expiry, the contract will normally be re-let following competition
amongst external providers. It might be possible to undertake activities more effectively in-
house through imaginative and innovative approaches rather than continue to pursue the
commercial solution. In such circumstances the existing commercial operation, together
with much of its working practices and corporate knowledge would be transferred in-
house. TLBs and Trading Funds will need to clearly demonstrate at the outset that the
introduction of competitive in-house proposals offer even better value for money (for
example by building on the experience of the commercial sector) when compared with
existing commercial arrangements. In such circumstances, a VfMB should be developed in
consultation with the Trade Unions, and considered alongside other commercially-based
options.

Extending Life of Existing Outsourced Contracts
51. The negotiation of an extension to a contract beyond its original performance,
cost and time envelope will be the exception and not the rule and will require a clear

business case. Extending an existing contract will usually be a short-term measure, and

34 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 must not be used to circumvent a competition for re-let. Value for money must be
demonstrated and subjected to appropriate scrutiny in all such cases. Legal and
Commercial Policy advice must be sought at an early stage to ensure that the MOD’s
obligations under the EU Services Directive and competition law are complied with and
that the Department’s industrial and competition policy is followed. Trade Unions must be
informed and given the opportunity to be consulted.

External Assistance

52. External Assistance can be summarised as the procurement from the private
sector of consultancy assistance. Cases seeking to procure External Assistance must
include all the elements of an appraisal as set out in Part 1, Chapter 2. In addition, the
following specific points apply:

a. Internal consultancy resources must be considered before External Assistance is
engaged. Alternative options for meeting the specified requirement must therefore
include the option of MOD internal resources, even if that would require re-
prioritisation of other tasks.

b. Trade Unions must be consulted on all proposals to procure External Assistance,
initially on an informal basis, which may lead to a formal consultation period where
TUs believe it necessary.

c. Skills Transfer from the External Assistance provider to MOD staff is required
unless it can be demonstrated not to be appropriate. The approach to ensure the
transfer of skills must be set out.

d. Cases must comply with DCP-EF-03-08-01 dated 11 June 2010 ‘External
Recruitment Freeze’.

53. Where there is a requirement to extend an existing contract, an evaluation must
be undertaken to assess the performance of the contractor. As long as the criteria set out
in paragraph 31 above apply, an investment appraisal is not required.

Disclosure of Financial Information to Industry

54. It is important that a disclosure strategy is drawn up before the project team
engages with industry. Project teams planning to release financial information to industry
should consult with Partnering Support Group (PSG) and Defence Economics, and provide
documented approval from the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) for the project. The
documented disclosure strategy should be referred to in the Concept of Analysis and Initial
Gate Business Case, or equivalents, Additional guidance is provided at Annex B.

55. The data shared with suppliers on particular programmes and projects will vary
depending on the procurement strategy being followed, and individual circumstance. The
underlying principle is to ensure disclosure is consistent with MOD securing the best value
for money solution to the taxpayer. However, there is a need to protect information whose
disclosure could harm security or international relations, undermine internal policy or
prejudice MOD’s position in negotiations with suppliers.

56. Where there is effective competition and adequate funding available, it is not

usually necessary to release financial information as the competitive process will ensure
value for money is delivered.

35 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 57. Where there is competition but the affordability of the requirement is in doubt, an
indication of the overall funding allocation (affordability envelope) and, where relevant, the
profile of that provision can be made. This may prevent nugatory activity from being
undertaken, and the competitive process should ensure the data provided does not
coincide with MOD’s willingness to pay.

58. In a non-competitive environment the extent to which MOD may be prepared to
disclose data must be judged on a case by case basis. Relevant guiding factors will
include: the position of a project in its lifecycle; potential sensitivities of international
partners when the project is a collaborative one; and the nature of the relationship already
established with specific companies. Examples of information that may be disclosed
include:

a. An indication of the overall funding allocation (affordability envelope) and, where
relevant, the profile of that provision. This should only be considered where the
affordability of the requirement is in doubt, and must not indicate MOD’s willingness
to pay.

b. ‘As Is’ or ‘baseline’ costs. This may help MOD and industry to gain a better
understanding of the existing operation. It will also help to ensure a comprehensive
and robust profile of the costs of the current arrangements is produced;

c. Details of technical efficiencies. Validation with industry will ensure both parties
have confidence that costs are robust and the solutions are deliverable.

d. Known planning assumptions across the life of the project, e.g. known out of service
dates.

59. Examples of information that would not normally be released include;

a. Relative price inflation, such as project specific earnings inflation. This is because it
could become self-fulfilling.

b. Details of operational (non-technical) efficiencies applied to the VfMB. This would
undermine the willingness of the Trade Unions to suggest such efficiencies or
engage in the process.

60. Under no circumstances should the following information be released to industry,
whether in a competitive or non-competitive environment:

a. Costed risk adjustments, in total, or by constituent parts;
b. Total VfMB figure inclusive of risk.

Fallback or Exit Strategy

61. There is no guarantee that the VfMB or the commercial bids will be affordable.
Where the VfMB is unaffordable through-life, a modified version that is affordable needs to
be developed, even if the resulting option provides lower capability. The affordable fallback
option will be used to help demonstrate the relative benefits of the commercial bids.

62. Financial provision should be continually reviewed to check the affordability
position of the options being developed, with regard to assumptions on e.g. balance sheet
treatment, and the ability to flex between RDel and CDel.

63. Solutions that are affordable through-life may have short-term affordability
shortfalls from one year to the next. Attempts to smooth short-term affordability peaks and

36 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 troughs with industry must take full consideration of the changes in risk profile this is likely
to bring.

Tender Evaluation and Value for Money

64. Public contracts must be competed in accordance with Public Contracts
Regulations 2006 (PCR) or Defence and Security Public Contracts Regulations 2011
(DSPCR) (the Regulations).

65. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) enshrines
principles of proportionality, equal treatment, non-discrimination and transparency which
the MOD must apply in relation to its contract award criteria. Application of these principles
also needs to be consistent with the policy requirement to demonstrate value for money.

66. This guidance is complementary and supplementary to that contained within the
Tendering Suite of Commercial Policy Statements (see www.aof.dii.r.mil.uk) addressing
the key issues to ensure that commercial, legal and economic requirements are coherently
addressed when establishing the criteria for tender evaluation.

Evaluation Strategy

67. The first decision to make is the appropriate evaluation strategy for the proposal,
and this is then published in the Contract Notice. In accordance with Regulation 31 of
DSPCR and Regulation 30 of PCR, the evaluation strategy can be based on either:

a. Lowest price (lowest cost). The contract will be awarded to the ‘lowest price’
tender that is technically and commercially compliant. This cannot be used if
the Competitive Dialogue procedure is being followed.

or

b. Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT). Using an evaluation
based on MEAT provides the opportunity to take criteria other than price into
account when awarding a contract. There are several MEAT evaluation
strategies that can be adopted. These are set out in the Commercial Policy
Statement on Tender Management.

Award Criteria

68. Award criteria are the criteria the tenders must meet and those that the tenders
will be measured against. Where a MEAT evaluation strategy is used, appropriate, specific
and relevant award criteria are scored and weighted to establish which tender is most
economically advantageous. The criteria should be sufficiently transparent so that a bidder
is aware of all the elements to be taken into account by MOD in identifying the most
economically advantageous and the relative importance of those elements. ‘Most
economically advantageous’ can be taken as being largely analogous to Value for Money
(VfM), where VfM is defined as the optimal trade-off between time, cost, and effectiveness.

69. Award criteria are typically grouped into three categories: technical, commercial
and financial. Deciding on the technical and commercial criteria to include is a matter of
judgement and will vary from project to project, but each needs to represent a specific and
measurable objective. In seeking to establish fundamental end objectives it is useful to:

37 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 a. Repeatedly ask the question ‘Why do you care about that?’;
b. Ask how the options differ from one another in ways that matter;
c. Ask about the overall objectives that are to be achieved.

The award criteria must relate to the goods or services to be provided and not to the
suitability of the supplier.

70. Note that choosing award criteria is a separate process to that of selection
criteria used to assess whether a potential bidder is capable of meeting the requirement.
Initially, this is done on the basis of economic/financial standing or technical/professional
ability, but an additional down-select may be exercised by applying other objective and
non-discriminatory criteria. Essentially, it is to determine which potential bidders will be
invited to participate in dialogue, negotiation, or tender.

71. Guidance on the selection, scoring and weighting of award criteria and the
evaluation methodology is caontained in Part2, chapter 8.

Publication of criteria

72. The award criteria must be discussed with, and endorsed by Defence Economics
and D Scrutiny or their TLB equivalents in addition to commercial and legal staff to ensure
that the criteria and weightings for tender evaluation are consistent with achieving value for
money. The award criteria and their weightings should ideally be endorsed before the
issue of the Contract Notice (OJEU advert) and must be endorsed and included in the
Tender Documentation before an Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD), Invitation to
Negotiate (ITN), or Invitation to Tender (ITT) is issued. Early engagement with scrutiny
staff is therefore essential.

Wider Markets Initiative

73. The Wider Markets Initiative (WMI) encourages the public sector to adopt a more
entrepreneurial approach to making the most effective and efficient use of public assets,
by using capacity which is surplus to normal requirements, but which must for wider
strategic or other reasons be retained within the public sector, to generate income. This
generally involves marketing the assets to private individuals or companies for revenue,
which can then be used to fund activities within the public sector. Holders of assets can
run Wider Markets projects themselves; or they may choose to engage a private sector
partner.

74. Policy on wider markets is set out in "Selling into Wider Markets: A Policy Note
for Public Bodies" HM Treasury 2002

(http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/ED8AB/New_WM_ Guidance.pdf)
75. When seeking to exploit irreducible spare capacity under this _ initiative,
regulations covering partnering and outsourcing apply in the normal way. Consideration
must be given to the following issues:

a. Treatment of fixed assets;

b. Allowance for additional costs to achieve third party income;

c. Need to appraise WMI against alternatives such as PFI.

 Annex A: Demonstrating the Policy -
Providing Evidence for the Audit Trail

The following questions should be considered simultaneously when providing evidence for
the audit trail.

1.

Circumstances where Defence Strategic Constraints apply to the
requirement.

Defence Strategic Considerations

Why do Defence Strategic Considerations apply to the requirement?
Can these be relaxed?

Are they tradeable?

Can a Security of Supply arrangement be used where appropriate?

Market Constraints

Is there a competitive market? If yes, use a competitive procurement approach.
Can the market be stimulated through market sounding, promoting the requirement
beyond the market segment from which it is usually procured, aggregating
requirements or breaking requirements down? If yes, use a competitive
procurement approach.

Can the requirement be reformulated to enable competitive procurement e.g.
breaking the requirement down to allow a single source to deliver the protected
element (subject to the Defence Strategic Considerations) whilst other elements are
procured through competition? If yes, use a competitive procurement and a sole
source approach for the protected element.

Does the MOD have access to IPR to enable competitive procurement? If yes, use
a competitive procurement approach and a sole source approach for the
protected element.

Can the IPR be licensed? If yes, use a competitive procurement approach
through licensing the IPR.

Where a non-competitive procurement approach is justified, can competition be
encouraged in the supply network?

. Circumstances where Defence Strategic Considerations do not apply

to the requirement

Is there a competitive market? If yes, use a competitive procurement approach.
Can the market be stimulated through market sounding, promoting the requirement
beyond the market segment from which it is usually procured, aggregating
requirements or breaking requirements down? If yes, use a competitive
procurement approach.

Can the requirement be reformulated to enable competitive procurement e.g.
breaking the requirement or aggregating requirements to stimulate industry’s
interest? If yes, use a competitive procurement approach.

Does the MOD have access to IPR to enable competitive procurement? If yes, use
a competitive procurement approach.

Can the IPR be licensed? If yes, use a competitive procurement approach
through licensing the IPR.

40 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 e Can the protected element (subject to IPR restrictions) be procured through a single
source arrangement whilst other elements are procured through competition? If
yes, use a competitive procurement approach and sole source for the
protected element.

e Where a non-competitive procurement approach is justified, demonstrate how
competition be encouraged in the supply network.

 Annex 8B: Disclosure’ of _ Financial
Information to Industry

When considering releasing financial information to industry, the key questions that must
be addressed are:

a. Why is it necessary or beneficial to release information?
b. What information is it appropriate to release?
c. When is the appropriate time to release information?

The answers to these questions may be different for each individual project, and Project
Team Leaders must decide what is right for their project. The aim will always be to
achieve a better deal for MOD without compromising its negotiating position and
securing best VfM to the taxpayer.

The Project Team Leader is accountable for the scale of the cost information released,
and is required to demonstrate that its release is appropriate in order to optimise the
potential for a value for money outcome. A record of the rationale applied must be
incorporated into the Disclosure Strategy documentation, and addressed as part of the
evaluation process for the project.

Key factors to be considered

The release of financial information should only occur after the consideration of all relevant
factors by the Project Team. The following provides a summary of the key factors:

e The assessment of the relative strength and practicability of effective competition.

e Is it necessary to release cost information or will the underlying assumptions be
sufficient?

e A judgement on the potential added value likely to be gained by the project in terms of
cost, time and performance

e What other non-financial information is being disclosed? Is it compatible with the cost
disclosure information?

e What outcome is required as a result of disclosure?

e Is disclosure likely to weaken MOD’s negotiating position?

Benefits

There are benefits from disclosure of information to industry in certain circumstances:

A full understanding on how business is currently conducted.

An awareness of the Authority's future requirements.

Identification of the key cost drivers and where efficiency gains may be possible.

Validation of technical efficiencies that could be incorporated into the VfMB in order

that all parties have confidence the costs are robust and the solutions are

deliverable.

e An opportunity to understand the business processes, in particular, where transfer
of risk benefits and business re-engineering can be made to best effect.

e Improve understanding of the capability deliverable from the funding available.

42 JSP 507 Pt.1 (V6.0 Jan 14)
 e Provides an indicative target for industry to aim at.
e The identification and understanding of risk.
e Prevents nugatory activity when affordability is severely constrained.

Risks

The risks associated with disclosure of information to industry include:

e Bidders may be inclined to bid just below the indicative target figure provided. This
can be mitigated by emphasising that meeting the target is unlikely to be sufficient
to secure the deal. Value for money does not necessarily mean selecting the
cheapest option.

e Loss of negotiating leverage. This should not be affected if negotiations are
pursued following extant commercial guidance.

e The unnecessary transfer of intellectual capital.
